# WebSocket vs Socket.IO

## WebSocket
1. **Protocol**: WebSocket is a communication protocol standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455. It provides a full-duplex, bidirectional communication channel over a single, long-lived TCP connection. It operates at the application layer (Layer 7 in the OSI model).

2. **Native in Browsers**: WebSocket is natively supported in most modern browsers, allowing you to create real-time applications without needing any additional libraries.

3. **Low-Level API**: WebSocket provides a relatively low-level API, which means you get more control over the connection and data transfer but may need to handle more complexity, such as reconnection logic, fallbacks, and handling different network conditions.

4. **Binary and Text**: WebSocket can send and receive both text and binary data.

5. **Cross-Origin Requests**: WebSocket inherently supports cross-origin requests, but the security model is more permissive than HTTP, so it requires careful handling.

## Socket.IO
1. **Library/Framework**: Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that provides an abstraction layer on top of WebSocket and other technologies, such as polling, to ensure reliable real-time communication across different platforms and environments.

2. **Automatic Fallbacks**: Socket.IO automatically falls back to other communication methods (like long polling) if WebSocket is not supported or available. This makes it more robust in environments with poor WebSocket support or unstable network conditions.

3. **High-Level API**: Socket.IO offers a higher-level API that is easier to use, with built-in features such as automatic reconnection, room management (for grouping clients), broadcasting events, and more.

4. **Event-Driven**: Socket.IO is designed around an event-driven model, which makes it easier to work with complex real-time communication scenarios.

5. **Additional Features**: Socket.IO provides additional features like broadcasting to multiple clients, room functionality, and middleware support, which are not provided by the native WebSocket API.

6. **Requires Server and Client Libraries**: Unlike WebSocket, which is supported natively in browsers, Socket.IO requires both a client-side library and a server-side library (typically in Node.js) to function.

7. **Cross-Origin Requests**: Socket.IO handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) more securely and with more flexibility, making it easier to manage security for cross-domain communications.

## Summary
- **WebSocket** is a lower-level, native protocol for real-time communication that is more lightweight but requires more manual handling.
- **Socket.IO** is a higher-level library that builds on WebSocket, providing additional features, automatic fallbacks, and an easier-to-use API, making it more robust for real-time applications across different environments.



# Difference Between `addEventListener`, `on`, and `emit`

## `addEventListener`
- **Usage**: `addEventListener` is a method in the DOM (Document Object Model) API used to listen to events on HTML elements (e.g., clicks, key presses).
- **Context**: Typically used in front-end JavaScript to handle events like `click`, `keydown`, etc.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Button clicked');
  });


## `on`
- **Usage**: `on` is a method used in various event-driven libraries (including Node.js EventEmitter, Socket.IO, jQuery, etc.) to register event handlers for specific events.
- **Context**: Commonly used in Node.js and Socket.IO to listen to events like incoming messages, connections, etc.
- **Example** in Socket.IO:
  ```javascript
  io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      console.log('A user connected');
      
      socket.on('message', (data) => {
          console.log(`Message received: ${data}`);
      });
  });


## `emit`
- **Usage**: `emit` is used to trigger events. When you emit an event, any listeners that have been set up to listen for that event will be executed.
- **Context**: Commonly used in Node.js and Socket.IO to send events to the server or from the server to clients.
- **Example** in Socket.IO:
  ```javascript
  // Server-side example
  socket.emit('message', 'Hello, client');

  // Client-side example
  socket.emit('message', 'Hello, server');


## Socket.IO Context
In the context of **Socket.IO**, `on` and `emit` are crucial for real-time communication between the server and clients.

### `on`
Used to listen for events. For example, when a message is received from a client, the server uses `on` to handle that event.

```javascript
// Server-side example
socket.on('message', (data) => {
    console.log(`Message from client: ${data}`);
});

// Client-side example
socket.on('message', (data) => {
    console.log(`Message from server: ${data}`);
});


### `emit`
Used to send events. For example, when the server wants to send a message to a client, it uses `emit`.

```javascript
// Server-side example
socket.emit('message', 'Hello from server');

// Client-side example
socket.emit('message', 'Hello from client');


// additional featur
1 - each user have his own random color
2 - predict the user next/current word
3 - if there is more than one active room if click on one of it leave the current room and join to new room just clicked on it
